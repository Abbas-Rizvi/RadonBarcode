# Radon Barcode - Content Based Image Retrieval Course Project

Image search via Radon Barcode projections

## Overview
The generation of a barcode to represent images has many practical
applications, both in image representation as well as search queries based on
an image. A Radon barcode is a type of barcode designed to represent the
contents of an image in a simplified yet comprehensive form. This barcode can
then be used to conduct searches based on an image, finding images that have
been found to produce similar barcodes. The use of a barcode to conduct the
search over other commonly used alternatives, such as those that look for
commonly occurring shapes in the content of an image, can be advantageous due
to the speed at which barcodes can be searched.
